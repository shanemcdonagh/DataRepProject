# Data Representation and Querying: Plant Buddy

Welcome to my final **Data Representation and Querying** project. 

This web application was developed using the MERN technology stack and displays all essential functionalities of a MERN application

The application also implements the basic functions that are essential to persistent storage: Create, Read, Update and Delete **(CRUD)**

The idea I chose to display the usage of a MERN application was a system in which presents the user a list of pre-defined plants and enables them to add them to their own list.
The user then has the option to choose which day the plant should be watered on to keep the plants nice and refreshed!

The reason for this idea was that I myself have house plants and quite often forget when I last watered them! I thought if I develop an application which I find useful, 
then my drive to create an intuitive tool would be immense!

Within the **Wiki** section, I have included a user guide. This provides a visual representation of the system features alongside a brief description on how to
use each of them in a simple, easy-to-follow manner.
